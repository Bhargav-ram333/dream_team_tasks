## 2. Purpose

This lean SRS defines the functional and non-functional requirements for **Project Name**. It is a concise blueprint for developers, designers, QA, and stakeholders to understand scope, features, acceptance criteria, and deliverables.

## 3. Scope

A short statement of what the system will do and not do.

**In scope:** Core product features A, B, C (replace with specifics).

**Out of scope:** Integrations X, offline mode Y (replace).

## 4. Definitions & Acronyms

* **User:** End user of the product
* **Admin:** Role with elevated privileges
* **API:** Application Programming Interface
* **MVP:** Minimum Viable Product

---

## 5. Stakeholders

* Product Owner — decides priorities
* Developers — implement features
* Designer — UI/UX
* QA — acceptance testing
* End users — use the product

---

## 6. High-level Architecture (1-line)

Client (web/mobile) ⇄ REST/GraphQL API ⇄ Service Layer ⇄ Database

---

## 7. User Personas (brief)

* **Visitor:** explores features, signs up
* **Registered User:** logs in, uses features, manages data
* **Admin:** manages users and content

---

## 8. Key Use Cases / User Stories

1. **Signup / Login** — As a Visitor I can sign up and log in so I can access personalized features.
2. **Create Resource** — As a Registered User I can create a Resource so I can save my work.
3. **Search & Filter** — As a User I can search and filter Resources to find items quickly.
4. **Admin Management** — As an Admin I can manage users and content.

Each user story should have acceptance criteria (see section 12).

---

## 9. Functional Requirements (numbered)

1. **FR-1: Auth** — System shall provide secure email/password authentication and password reset.
2. **FR-2: CRUD Resources** — System shall allow create, read, update, delete operations on Resources.
3. **FR-3: Search API** — System shall expose a paginated search endpoint with filters.
4. **FR-4: Role-Based Access** — System shall enforce role-based permissions.
5. **FR-5: Notifications** — System shall send email notifications on key events.

*Notes:* Each FR must map to acceptance tests and API endpoints.

---

## 10. Non-functional Requirements

* **NFR-1 (Performance):** 95th percentile API latency < 300 ms for 95% of requests under expected load.
* **NFR-2 (Availability):** 99.5% uptime (MVP target).
* **NFR-3 (Security):** OWASP Top 10 mitigations; all passwords hashed (bcrypt/scrypt/Argon2).
* **NFR-4 (Scalability):** System must scale horizontally for the service layer.
* **NFR-5 (Localization):** Support for i18n; English v1.

---

## 11. Data Model (summary)

Primary entities:

* **User**: id, name, email, role, created_at
* **Resource**: id, owner_id, title, body, tags, created_at, updated_at
* **ActivityLog**: id, user_id, action, target_id, timestamp

Include ER diagram in design docs.

---

## 12. APIs (surface)

* `POST /api/v1/auth/signup` — sign up
* `POST /api/v1/auth/login` — login (returns JWT)
* `GET /api/v1/resources` — list resources (pagination)
* `POST /api/v1/resources` — create resource
* `GET /api/v1/resources/:id` — read resource
* `PUT /api/v1/resources/:id` — update resource
* `DELETE /api/v1/resources/:id` — delete resource

*Contract details (payloads, response codes) go into the API spec.*

---

## 13. UI/UX Guidelines (concise)

* Clean, modern layout; sidebar + content area for desktop.
* Mobile-first responsive design; prioritize primary actions.
* Use 8pt baseline grid, 16px base font, accessible contrast, and WCAG AA.
* Simple, consistent microcopy and empty-state illustrations.

---

## 14. Security & Privacy

* Use TLS everywhere.
* Store secrets in vaults; no secrets in repo.
* Least-privilege for services and DB users.
* Comply with applicable data protection laws (GDPR/other) — store minimal PII.

---

## 15. Testing & QA

* Unit tests for core logic; integration tests for API; E2E for critical flows.
* CI: run tests, linting, and build validations on pull requests.
* Acceptance tests mapped to each FR.

---

## 16. Deployment & DevOps (brief)

* Containerized services (Docker).
* CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys to staging then production after approval.
* Use infrastructure-as-code for environments.

---

## 17. Acceptance Criteria (example)

* FR-1: Signup success when email & password valid; verification email sent; cannot sign up with duplicate email.
* FR-3: Search returns correct items, paginated, <300ms average on staging under baseline load.

---

## 18. Deliverables & Timeline (MVP)

* Week 0–2: Setup, auth, user model
* Week 3–6: Core CRUD + search
* Week 7–9: UI polish, notifications, admin
* Week 10: Stabilize, E2E tests, launch

Adjust to team capacity.

---

## 19. Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk:** Third-party API rate limits — **Mitigation:** caching & retries.
* **Risk:** Data privacy compliance — **Mitigation:** legal review early.

---

## 20. Appendices

* A: Wireframes (link)
* B: API contract (OpenAPI)
* C: ER diagrams

---

*How to use this SRS:* Replace placeholders, expand FRs into granular tickets (Jira/GitHub Issues), create API contract and UI mockups, and map each FR to acceptance tests.
